Lab 0 for CS100, Fall 2019

My project is a website that provides useful information on carrots. It has a homepage, a page with nutrition data, and a page with links to more useful information. The primary navigation uses a bootstrap navbar.

Code Structure:
- index.html: The html code for the home page
- health.html: The html code for the "Details" page
- reading.html: The html code for the "Reading" page
- style.css: Additional CSS styling done here (On top of bootstrap styling)
- logo.png: My carrot icon (Sourced from freepik)
- carrots.png: The picture of the carrots (Sourced from pngall)
